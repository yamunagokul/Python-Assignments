## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Because they are not written in machine-readable language. Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans: Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime. No need to mention the type of the varable

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans: 
Pros :                                 
=>It's Simple                            
=>It's Free                               
=>It's Easy to Use                        
=>It's Highly Compatible 
=>It is Object-Oriented
=>It has Lots of Libraries
=>Clear and Readable Syntax
=>Interpreted Language

Cons:

=>Security

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:
 1. Data Engineering
 2. AI
 3. Deep learning
 4. Mchine Learning
 5. Web development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
 
Ans:
  1.Interger =>  inr_var=10
  2.Float => float_var=4.5
  3.String => str_var= "Yamuna" or 'Yamuna'
  4.Boolean => bool_var=True or False
  

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: Usinf input() function we can take input from python.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: Every input taken via input() is str. We have to type cast it.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes, we take more than one input from the user using single input() function.
By using split() function.

Eg:
a,b = input("Enter two numbers : ").split()
print(a)
print(b)

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.

Eg: break, continue, true, false, and, or, not,

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, we cannot use keywords as variable

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: print() function is used to get the output

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans:
=>Arithmatic Operator
=>Assignment operator
=>Comparison Operator
=>Logical operator

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: 
/ for float division
// for interger division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: 
for i in range(4):
     print('yamuna',end='')
     
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: 
b=int(input("Enter a number"))
if (b % 2)==0:
     print("This is even number")
else:
     print("This is odd number")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: AND, OR, NOT

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0  => True

0 and 0  => False

True and False and True => False

1 or 0 or 0 => True
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans:
=>if.
=>if..else.
=>Nested if.
=>if-elif statements.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans:
=> If: It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the ” if ” block will be executed otherwise not.
=> Else: It decides what to do if the condition is False. 
=> elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: 

num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num1>=18:
   print("I can vote")
else:
   print("I cann't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: 392
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
total_even=0
for i in range(0, len(numbers)):
     #print(numbers[i])
     if (numbers[i] % 2)==0:
          #print(numbers[i])
          total_even=total_even+numbers[i]  
print(total_even) 


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans:
num1, num2, num3=input("Enter the Value 1").split()

if(num1 > num2 and num1 > num3):
    temp=num1
elif(num2>num1 and num2>num3):
     temp=num2
else:
     temp=num3

print(temp)


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in range(0,len(numbers)):
    if (numbers[i] % 5)==0 and numbers[i]<=150:
        print(numbers[i])
    elif numbers[i]>500:
          break

```
